def prime[T](awaitable: Awaitable[T], /, *, loop: Optional[AbstractEventLoop] = None) -> Awaitable[T]:
  """
  Prime an awaitable such that as much code as possible is executed immediately.
  This is akin to creating tasks with `asyncio.eager_task_factory` as the task
  factory.

  If the returned awaitable is not awaited, the closure of the original
  awaitable is only performed during garbage collection. If the event loop is
  closed, async cleanup operations will fail.

  Parameters
  ----------
  awaitable
    The awaitable to prime.
  loop
    The event loop to use while priming. If `None`, the current running loop
    must exist and is used.

  Returns
  -------
  Awaitable[T]
    An awaitable that returns the result of the provided awaitable.
